I can't spend another night trying to conjure up the way I've felt over the past two years.
Whether it's disappointment, anger, frustration, or the loss of emotion.
I probably just need some rest.

All we've ever wanted is to feel alive when we wake up in the morning.
So we'll set aside what we need to be, and we'll try, and we'll fail,
And we'll die and be remembered for what it was.
But to be remembered means so much more that what we needed to be.

And it seems like every time that I fuck up I tell myself it's the last time
But the next day find myself defeated again.
So I'll keep these two years in the past, along with the anger and frustration,
Because tonight I'll feel safe in a stranger's basement.
