So they dance and get candy?
I don't remember dancing, talk to me
Dancing where?
Behind the truck
What truck?
The candy truck

Where was the candy truck?
Down the street
This street?
Down the street
And everyone went dancing on this truck?
Mm-hmm

Don't much remember much, I know there was a truck
And if you did something with candy, it was good

Dancing truck

What kind of candy did you get?
Uh, like, some coffee candy
I think I chewed on a coffee flavor
That sounds good
Could you help me? You'll get candy

She said, "Oh, baby, won't you change your tune?"
Oh, why you gotta talk about it?
I'm feeling like I don't know you
So far away, so 'way

So 'way, so 'way
So 'way, so 'way
So far away, so 'way
So 'way, so 'way
So—

She said, "Oh, baby, won't you change your tune?"
Why you gotta talk about it?
I'm feeling like I don't know you
So far away, so 'way

Change your tune
Why you gotta talk about it?
I'm feeling like I don't know you
So far away, so 'way

Change your tune
Why you gotta talk about it?
I'm feeling like I don't know you
So far away, so 'way
